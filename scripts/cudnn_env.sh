# torch 2.12.1+cu130 bundles cuDNN 9.20, which does not ship libcudnn_engines_tensor_ir. cuDNN's
# dispatcher dlopens that engine anyway and finds the host's 9.25 copy in /usr/lib, then rejects it
# with CUDNN_STATUS_SUBLIBRARY_VERSION_MISMATCH. Every convolution then fails, which is what
# cudnn_guard.py works around by disabling cuDNN entirely -- correct but slow.
#
# CORRECTION: this restores cuDNN but does NOT speed up WAFT track generation. Measured on the
# same clips, 32.7 s/clip with cuDNN against 35.4 without -- about 1.08x. An earlier claim of
# 15.8x here was wrong: it compared tqdm's instantaneous rate over a stretch where most clips
# were already on disk and skipped instantly. WAFT's cost is dominated by something other than
# cuDNN convolutions. Keep this file because a correct cuDNN is worth having and costs nothing,
# not because it makes this job fast.
#
# The fix is to make the whole set 9.25, matching the host, by putting a complete 9.25 wheel ahead
# of the bundled one on the loader path. Upgrading the venv's nvidia-cudnn-cu13 instead does NOT
# work: torch 2.12.1 pins 9.20.0.48, and asking for 9.25 makes the resolver downgrade torch to
# 2.10.0, which would invalidate every measurement in the paper.
